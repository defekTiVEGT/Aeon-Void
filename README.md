# Aeon-Void
A game written in Processing using a arduino for a capacitive touch based controller.

Written in 2013 while attending Digipen summer courses. I believe this to be the final version. My code versioning back then was atrocious.

The capacitive input handler was written by Brian Tugade. I don't know where it can originally be found anymore.
