# Aeon-Void
A game written in Processing using a arduino for a capacitive touch based controller. It even fired a real Helium-Neon gas laser.

Written in 2013 while attending Digipen summer courses. I believe this to be the final version. My code versioning back then was atrocious.

Arduino code is in the (Terribly named) AeonVoid subdirectory.

The capacitive input handler was written by Brian Tugade (and is credited as such in the arduino .ino file). I don't know where it can originally be found anymore.
